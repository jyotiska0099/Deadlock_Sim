# Project Overview
A C++ project that extends the Banker's Algorithm to create a real-time deadlock detection system. This simulator provides an interactive interface for dynamic resource allocation and visualization of resource allocation graphs, helping users understand and prevent deadlocks in systems.


### Key Features:
- Deadlock Detection: Utilizes the Banker's Algorithm to detect potential deadlocks.
- Interactive Interface: Allows users to allocate and release resources dynamically.
- Graph Visualization: Displays resource allocation graphs to visualize system state.

### Project Goals:
- Educate users about deadlock prevention strategies.
- Provide a tool for testing and analyzing system configurations.

### Getting Started:
- Clone the repository.
- Build using CMake.
- Run the executable to start the simulator.

### Contributions:
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit pull requests or report issues.
